# 👋 Welcome to My Digital Forge

Hey there, traveler of the codeverse. I'm Brahim, a developer from Tunisia 🇹🇳 building cool things with clean code and chaotic curiosity.

This is where I stash my projects, experiments, and open-source adventures. If it runs on JavaScript, I’ve probably poked at it. If it doesn’t... I might still try.

## ⚒️ Tech Stack

Currently crafting things with:

- **Frontend:** React.js, Tailwind CSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express, FastAPI
- **Database:** MongoDB, PostgreSQL
- **Extras:** TypeScript, Vite, Git (because breaking things without version control is just pain)

Always learning. Always building. Sometimes breaking things just to see how they work.

## 🎬 When Not Coding

You’ll probably find me buried in a movie, deep-diving random topics, or imagining systems no one asked for. The brain doesn’t clock out.
